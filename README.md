# advanced_intralogistics_project
This project was created to solve the challenge of managing multiple, disconnected IoT devices in a typical office environment. Instead of using separate apps for security, access control, and climate, the Smart Office Hub provides a centralized dashboard for seamless operation.

The core workflow is simple:

A visitor arrives and presses the Ring doorbell.

A notification with a live video feed is sent to the application.

An authorized employee verifies the visitor's identity and clicks a button to grant access.

The application sends a command to the Brivo system to unlock the door.

Separately, employees can use the same dashboard to view and adjust the room's temperature via the Ecobee+ thermostat.
